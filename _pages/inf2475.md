* Currently engaged in academic research related to the application of genetic algorithms at PUCP.

* Developed a web and app system for processing client deposits. This system automates the extraction of information from uploaded PDFs, verifies deposits against bank statements, and updates client debts. It also features a reward system for regular deposits. 
This innovation has the potential to save up to S/ 120 daily or S/ 3600 monthly by reducing the need for dedicated staff for collection and account management.
